Hey there! 😎

I’m Gideon, a frontend developer and programmer who loves building anything that sparks my curiosity.

If an idea grabs my attention, I’ll explore it, prototype it, and bring it to life. I enjoy working across different technologies, experimenting with new concepts, and pushing myself to create things that feel sharp, intuitive, and purposeful.

My primary stack consists of React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind, but I’m not limited to any single domain. I move comfortably between interfaces, systems, mobile development, and even hacking and cybersecurity whenever I want to sharpen my edge.

Outside of coding, you’ll probably find me:

🏀 On the basketball court

🛠️ Building small experiments and passion projects

📚 Diving into new ideas to stay inspired

I’ve built a mix of public and private projects, and I’m always chasing the next challenge that keeps me growing.

If you want to connect or collaborate, I’m always open. Let’s create something exceptional. 🚀
